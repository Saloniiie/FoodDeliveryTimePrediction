The aim of this project is to develop a food delivery time prediction model using concepts of Recursive Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The model will take into account various factors such as distance, traffic, weather conditions etc. While the initial focus is on predicting time delivery, the model can be extended to other industries that require time-sensitive delivery services.
